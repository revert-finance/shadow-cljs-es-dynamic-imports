* TLDR;

Seems that dynamic imports are not working, previously it was a thing of the google closure compiler not supporting it but now it I think is supported according to https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/JS-Modules#dynamic-import-expressions.

In this case I am using [[https://www.rainbowkit.com/][Rainbow kit]] a library to connect and use a crypto wallet. This library is using dynamic imports to fetch svg's https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/blob/2e6bb8ff3850eb4e341d82b77d52b18df4bfd698/packages/rainbowkit/src/wallets/walletConnectors/metaMaskWallet/metaMaskWallet.ts#L53.

The issue happens when you click the connect button and the main modal appears.

To demonstrate it I created this demo that has 2 "Connect Wallet" buttons side by side.

1. One using the [[https://www.rainbowkit.com/][Rainbow kit]] npm library as shadow cljs users guide indicates ([[https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_using_npm_packages][using npm packages]]). [[https://github.com/revert-finance/shadow-cljs-es-dynamic-imports/blob/main/src/main/rainbow.cljs#L36][Button source code]]
2. Other using a compiled version of this library that uses a babel plugin to remove the dynamic imports ([[https://github.com/ChristianMurphy/babel-plugin-transform-dynamic-imports-to-static-imports][babel-plugin-transform-dynamic-imports-to-static-imports]]). Check the vite.config.ts file. [[https://github.com/revert-finance/shadow-cljs-es-dynamic-imports/blob/main/src/main/rainbow.cljs#L21][Button source code]]

** 1. This is the result when using the library as an npm package
As you can see the wallet icons are missing

** 2. This is the result when removing the dynamic imports
As you can see the wallet icons are not missing
